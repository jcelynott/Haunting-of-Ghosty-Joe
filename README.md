# The Haunting-of-Ghosty-Joe
A very silly post-Halloween game about an old Baron and a spooky ghost named Joe

### Background
This was made for the 2019 OneButtonGameJam over on itch.io, designed with the challenge of using only one button as an input to promote accessability and creative design decisions.

### Language and Framework
I built The Haunting of Ghosty Joe with C#. The game relies on the Unity Engine and its associated libraries
