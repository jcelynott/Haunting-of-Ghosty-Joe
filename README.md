# The Haunting-of-Ghosty-Joe
A very silly post-Halloween game about an old Baron and a spooky ghost named Joe

### Background
This was made for the 2019 OneButtonGameJam over on itch.io, designed with the challenge of using only one button as an input to promote accessability and creative design decisions.

### Language and Framework
I built The Haunting of Ghosty Joe with C#. The game relies on the Unity Engine and its associated libraries

### A Note for the MLH Fellowship Code Review
There are quite a few scripts in the game, but some of them are small files made to handle very specific details of the game. Examples of longer files include the ButtonChecker, its child classes, and the DangerSpawner.
